## How it works
Video Fetch is a Python script that is able to download Youtube videos at the highest resolution available via the Pytube library.

Once you've cloned this repo to your local, open a terminal instance and navigate to the repo folder. From there, you will run the script using the following command: 

`python3 script.py`

In terminal, you will be asked to enter the URL of the Youtube video you'd like to download. Paste the URL and presss `Enter`.

Downloading the file may take a few moments, but once it's done, you will see a `Video downloaded successfully!` message. The video will download to the folder you've run the script, so you should see the file download directly to the repo folder. 

Have fun!

## Quick Note

It is possible that by downloading the Youtube video, you are breaking Youtube's terms and conditions, so use caution.
